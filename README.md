# Welcome to the SBprofiles repository

There are two things going on here:

1. **Original code:** If you're interested in reviewing or adapting the code
  we used when writing the manuscript, check out the
  [manuscript_code directory](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/tree/main/manuscript_code).

2. **Usage help:** The rest of this repository is set up as an R package to help
  you if you want to use the profiles yourself. We've given full information and
  instructions in the [vignette](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/blob/main/vignettes/SBprofiles.pdf).
  
# Attribution

This repository would not exist without the public domain data available from the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/). Outside of the [example data](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/tree/main/data) and elements of the [internal data](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/blob/main/R/sysdata.rda) (see also [data-raw](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/tree/main/data-raw)), everything data-related in this repository should be code that will point you to the original site from which you can access the data for yourself. Regardless, none of the source data should be construed as belonging to the maintainer(s) of this repository. Those who worked hard to procure the data deserve to be attributed as such!
