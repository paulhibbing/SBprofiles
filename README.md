# Welcome to the SBprofiles repository

There are two things going on here:

1. **Original code:** If you're interested in reviewing or adapting the code
  we used when writing the manuscript, check out the
  [manuscript_code directory](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/tree/master/manuscript_code).

2. **Usage help:** The rest of this repository is set up as an R package to help
  you if you want to use the profiles yourself. We've given full information and
  instructions in the [vignette](https://github.com/paulhibbing/SBprofiles/blob/master/vignettes/SBprofiles.pdf).
